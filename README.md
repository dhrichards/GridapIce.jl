# GridapIce ðŸš§ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§ðŸš§

This package aims to solve the full-stokes equations for ice flow, with a variety of anisotropic tensor rheologies and coupled to fabric evolution and free surface evolution. It is currently working in serial with the aim of working in parallel.


## To do:
 - Preconditioner for power-law rheology to run in parallel
 - Tests
